# OS Work
Work of Operating Systems, where we've got to implement **scheduling algorithms** working with semaphores and threads, using pthread.h and semaphore.h in C.

## Scheduling Algorithms
- Non-preemptive
  - FCFS/FIFO
  - SJF
  - Non-preemptive Priority
  - HRRN
- Preemptive
  - RR (Round-robin)
  - Priority FIFO/FCFS
  - Priority with RR
  - SRT

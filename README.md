# OS Work
Work of Operating Systems, where we've got to implement **scheduling algorithms** working with semaphores and threads, using pthread.h and semaphore.h in C.

## Scheduling Algorithms
- Non-preemptive
  - [FCFS/FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))
  - [SJF/SJN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_job_next)
  - [Non-preemptive Priority](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-non-preemptive-priority-scheduling)
  - [HRRN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest_response_ratio_next)
- Preemptive
  - [Round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling)
  - [Priority FIFO/FCFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-priority_pre-emptive_scheduling)
  - [Priority with RR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling)
  - [SRT](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_remaining_time)
